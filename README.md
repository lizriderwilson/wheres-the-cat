# Where's the Cat?

Where's the Cat? is a game made in 72 hours for [The Indie Tales Jam](https://itch.io/jam/indie-tales-jam) using GameMaker Studio 2. All art, code, and sound effects were created July 9-11 2021.

## Gameplay

Use the arrow keys, WASD keys, or the D-pad of a game controller to move around the room. The cat will purr intermittently - it is your job to find where they are hiding without disturbing them, or else they'll run away from you so quickly it's as if they teleported!
